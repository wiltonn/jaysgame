# PRD ‚Äî **Fan Playoffs: Hyper-Social Trivia**

**Owner:** You
**Doc type:** Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Version:** v1.0
**Status:** Draft for build planning

---

## 1) Problem, Vision, Success

**Problem**
Sports trivia is fun in small groups, but most tools feel like school quizzes. They‚Äôre not built for watch-parties, multiple age groups, or ‚Äúwe‚Äôre-all-fans‚Äù energy. Hosts need something simple, social, and scalable from a living-room to a packed bar.

**Vision**
A hyper-social, playoff-style trivia platform that feels like a game night and a playoff run had a baby: short matches (innings/periods), series, brackets, and seasons‚Äîwrapped in fan reactions, highlight clips, optional geolocation crowd maps, and ‚Äúheckle‚Äù humor.

**North-star outcome**
Players feel like they participated in a _game_, not a test. Venues and communities can run leagues, creators can publish packs, and fans of any age can jump in within 30 seconds.

**Primary KPIs**

- D1 game completion rate ‚â• **85%**
- Avg players/session (hosted) ‚â• **12**
- 30-day retention (hosts) ‚â• **25%**
- Content reuse (packs used ‚â•3 times in 30 days) ‚â• **40%**
- NPS (players) ‚â• **55**

---

## 2) Target Users & Use Cases

**Personas**

- **Host Hannah (bar/club/teacher/parent):** Wants quick setup, QR join, TV display, simple controls.
- **Fan Frank (50+, hardcore):** Wants nostalgia, clips, no fiddly UI, big text, jokes.
- **Family Fiona (mixed ages):** Wants inclusive difficulty, chill timers, read-aloud.
- **Creator Chris:** Wants to upload/curate team packs and get distribution.

**Core use cases**

1. **Pickup Game (9 Innings)** at home or bar, 10‚Äì30 players, mobile join, TV scoreboard.
2. **Best-of-3 Series** between squads in a Discord or alumni group.
3. **Venue League Night** with bracketed tournament and weekly standings.
4. **Watch-Party Mode** during live sports (fast rounds between commercials).

---

## 6) Functional Requirements

### Host/Player

- **R1.** Players join via QR/URL; pick nickname; optional avatar; optional location (city).
- **R2.** Host can start/pause/skip inning; inject heckle; trigger media reveal.
- **R3.** Questions broadcast in real time; client shows timer bar; submits answer once (lock after).
- **R4.** Scoring: +1 run for correct; ‚ÄúGrand Slam‚Äù question worth 4 runs; (toggle) +1 for fastest-five with latency normalization.
- **R5.** Leaderboard and **line score by inning**; MVP = top score tiebreaker ‚Äúearliest total time.‚Äù
- **R6.** 7th-inning stretch shows clip or meme vote (non-scored by default).
- **R7.** Postgame: shareable result card (PNG), replay summary for host.

### Packs & Admin

- **R8.** Creator can import CSV/Google Sheet or JSON; system validates and previews pack.
- **R9.** Pack tagging: era, difficulty, media-safe.
- **R10.** Admin can feature packs, hide problematic content, or mark ‚Äúkids-safe.‚Äù

### Social & Geolocation

- **R11.** Reactions broadcast as bursts (throttled).
- **R12.** Map shows city-level pins; exact GPS never shown; seating overlay mode for privacy.

### Anti-Cheat & Fairness

- **R13.** Shuffle choices per player session.
- **R14.** Speed bonus uses **answerAt - shownAt** minus **client latency estimate**.
- **R15.** Basic duplicate detection: same account/device fingerprint warns host in ‚Äúprize mode.‚Äù

### Observability

- **R16.** Emit analytics: join, answer, correct/incorrect, reaction, stretch participation, drop.
- **R17.** Host dashboard: players joined, median answer time, completion.

---

## 7) Non-Functional Requirements

- **Capacity:** 500 concurrent players per match (v1 target 50‚Äì100 typical).
- **Availability:** 99.5% SLA (Phase 2+).
- **Privacy:** GDPR/CPRA aligned; explicit opt-in for location; COPPA gate for kids mode.
- **Security:** Rate limits, auth tokens for host/admin, signed media URLs, no third-party cookies.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA.

---

## 8) System Design

**Client (recommended)**

- **SvelteKit** (or Next.js) + **Tailwind**
- **Socket.IO client** for rooms & events
- **Leaflet** for maps; **YouTube embeds** for clips

**Server**

- **Node.js (TypeScript)** with **Express** or **NestJS**
- **Socket.IO** for realtime
- **Postgres** (Prisma) for persistent data
- **Redis** for rooms/presence/leaderboards/rate limits
- **S3-compatible** storage for images/thumbnails

**Deployment**

- Single region to start; CDN for static; autoscale app + Redis.
- Feature flags (e.g., LaunchDarkly or simple env toggles).

**Key Services**

- `match-service` (state machine, scoring, events)
- `pack-service` (CRUD/validation)
- `bracket-service` (Phase 2)
- `analytics-service` (event ingestion to warehouse)

---

## 9) Game State & Events

### Match State Machine

`lobby ‚Üí inning[n]:question ‚Üí inning[n]:reveal ‚Üí (stretch at 7th) ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí postgame`

### Socket Events (subset)

- **Server ‚Üí Clients:**
  `state:update`, `question:show`, `question:reveal`, `score:update`, `stretch:start`, `stretch:end`, `match:end`
- **Client ‚Üí Server:**
  `player:join {name, avatar, cityOptIn}`, `answer:submit {qId, choice}`, `reaction:send {emoji}`, `host:control {action}`

**Latency normalization**
On `answer:submit`, store `(serverReceiveTs - questionStartTs) - clientReportedLatencyMs` for speed-bonus fairness.

---

## 10) Data Model (simplified)

```
Org(id, name, theme)
User(id, displayName, ageMode, cityOptIn, createdAt)
Pack(id, meta, innings JSONB, ownerId, tags[], isFeatured, isKidsSafe)
Match(id, orgId, packId, mode, startedAt, endedAt, settings JSONB)
MatchPlayer(id, matchId, userId, nickname, avatar, city)
MatchAnswer(id, matchId, userId, inningIdx, qIdx, choice, isCorrect, answerMs, bonusAwarded)
Leaderboard(id, matchId, totals JSONB)
Bracket(id, orgId, name, type, seeds JSONB, rounds JSONB)  // Phase 2
```

---

## 11) APIs (HTTP) & Realtime (Socket)

**HTTP (admin/creator)**

- `POST /api/packs/import` (CSV/JSON) ‚Üí `{packId}`
- `GET /api/packs/:id` (signed)
- `POST /api/matches` ‚Üí `{matchId, joinCode}`
- `GET /api/matches/:id/summary` (host)

**Socket (rooms by matchId)**

- `join:match {matchId, nickname, cityOptIn}`
- `host:action {matchId, action: 'start'|'pause'|'skip'|'reveal'|'stretch'}`
- `answer:submit {qId, choice, clientLatencyMs}`
- Broadcasts: `state:update`, `leaderboard`, `clip:reveal {url}`

---

## 12) Scoring & Brackets

**Runs**

- Correct = +1 run.
- Inning 9 Grand Slam = +4.
- (Optional) Speed bonus +1 to fastest five correct, normalized for latency.

**Ties**

- Home Run Derby: 3 quick `tf` questions; most correct wins; still tied ‚Üí sudden-death.

**Seeding (Phase 2)**

- Elo-like update: `E = 1/(1+10^((Rb-Ra)/400))`, `Ra' = Ra + K*(S - E)`; K=16 default.

---

## 13) Content & Moderation

- Packs tagged by **era**, **difficulty**, **kids-safe**, **media-heavy**.
- Upload flow validates CSV/JSON structure and link embeddability.
- Report flow for problematic questions; admin hide.
- Rights: only **embed** licensed clips (no re-hosting).

---

## 14) Analytics & Reporting

**Events**
`match_created, player_joined, question_shown, answer_submitted, correct, incorrect, reaction_sent, stretch_participated, match_completed, drop_off`

**Dashboards**

- Match funnel: joins ‚Üí answers ‚Üí completion.
- Avg answer time; question difficulty index (correct rate).
- Content performance: pack reuse, abandon rate by inning.
- Venue league standings (Phase 2).

---

## 15) Privacy, Security, Compliance

- Location is **opt-in**; default to **city only**; never share exact GPS.
- Kids mode requires guardian confirmation; no location in kids rooms.
- Store minimal PII (nickname by default).
- Rate limit reactions/answers to prevent floods.
- CSRF on HTTP; JWT for host/admin; secure WebSocket upgrade.

---

## 16) Acceptance Criteria (MVP)

- **A1. Join:** Player can join a match via QR/URL within 30s on mid-tier mobile.
- **A2. Questions:** All players receive a question within 200ms of each other; answer locks after submit; server records exactly one answer per player.
- **A3. Scoring:** Correct answers award +1 run; inning 9 correctly awards +4; leaderboard updates in ‚â§300ms.
- **A4. Stretch:** Host can trigger a 30s media segment that plays on TV and clients.
- **A5. Map:** If ‚â•1 player opts in, a city-level map renders; disabling location hides map immediately.
- **A6. Accessibility:** Big-Text Mode increases base font ‚â•28pt; read-aloud speaks full question text.
- **A7. Reliability:** If a player refreshes, they rejoin the current inning without losing prior answers.

---

## 17) QA Plan (high level)

- **Unit:** scoring, latency normalization, pack validation.
- **Integration:** socket rooms, reconnection mid-inning, TV display sync.
- **Load:** 100 concurrent players answering within 5s; no dropped events.
- **Accessibility:** keyboard navigation, screen reader labels, contrast checks.
- **Cross-device:** iOS Safari, Android Chrome, desktop Chrome/Edge/Firefox, AirPlay/Chromecast TV.

---

## 18) Risks & Mitigations

- **Clip rights confusion** ‚Üí Only allow embeds; educate creators; pre-curate official links.
- **Network variability** ‚Üí Latency-normalized speed bonus; Chill Mode without speed points.
- **Onboarding friction** ‚Üí QR + no account required for players; hosts sign-in only.
- **Geolocation privacy** ‚Üí City-only default; per-match consent; clear toggle.

---

## 19) Roadmap

**Phase 1 ‚Äî MVP (Pickup Game) [4‚Äì6 weeks]**

- 9-inning match, packs import/validate, host console, TV display, reactions, heckles, Big-Text, read-aloud, city-level map, basic analytics.

**Phase 2 ‚Äî Series & Brackets [4‚Äì6 weeks]**

- Best-of-3/5/7, bracket UI, Elo seeding, venue league night preset, prize mode safeguards.

**Phase 3 ‚Äî Marketplace & Skins [6‚Äì8 weeks]**

- Creator portal, pack discovery, team/league skins, seasonal themes, richer analytics, sponsorship hooks.

If you want, I can convert this PRD into:

- a **ticket set** (user stories + acceptance criteria) for your backlog,
- a **Postgres schema + Prisma models**, and
- a **UI wireframe kit** (host console, player, TV) you can hand straight to devs/design.
